#### Design choices

The design style chosen for the project is in a modern, minimalist aesthetic to alingn with the band logo

### Website Structure

The website consists of three pages: Home, Media, and Gallery, The Home page contains the bulk of the content with 2 different sections: 5 Images in an auto rotating carousel, and a Bio section. The navbar is in a fixed position, so that it's visable to allow access to navigation at all times. The footer is static on all pages with easy acces from the provided link in the navbar.

### Colour Scheme 

![colour-palette](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/Missioned_Souls_Colour_Pallette_mkgzei.png)

The above colour palette, inspired by the photosbands logo featured on the website, is used throughout the project.

Midnight Green (#26525e)

I used this for the main heading.

Anti-flash White (#eef1f1)

Serves as the main background colour for the body and as the highlight colour for the active navigation links

Light Blue (#a1c9ce)

Used for the general navigation link text and social network icons

Gunmetal (#18343e)

Used for the bio section text and as the fallback background colour for the navbar

### Typography 

- 'Fredoka' sans-serif Google font is applied as the main font for the entire body of the website and used for the text in the navigation links
- 'Jacques Francois Shadow' sans-serif Google font is used for the headings throguhout the website.
- Font Awesome icons have been used for social media links in the footer.

### Images

To optimize the site, I compressed local images used with the tool TinyPNG (see tools) Images for the (_Gallery_) page were uploaded to Cloudinary (see tools) rather than hosted locally. This decision was made to ensure faster loading times, responsive delivery across all devices, and streamlined image management, thanks to Cloudinary's powerful optimisation capabilities and global content delivery network.

## Technologies

For this project, GitHub was used to host the repository, and VS Code served as the integrated development environment (IDE). To ensure the site is fully responsive and to manage development time effectively, the Bootstrap framework was utilised.

- This project includes HTML and CSS language

- I also installed the extension Prettier - formatter to format the code

## Testing

### Validation

To validate the code, I used W3C validation sevice (see tools).

## Lighthouse

### HTML

**index.html errors and clearance**

Initially, `index.html` presented a validation error.

### Initial Errors:
This image highlights the error identified in the initial validation pass of `index.html`.

    * *The validation report showing a clean bill of health for `index.html`*

**media.html errors and clearance**

Initially, `media.html` presented a significant number of validation errors. These issues primarily stemmed from incorrect attribute formatting within the <video> tags and invalid type values in the <source> tags. This formatting was brought on by using a different HTML formatter before using Beautify again.

### Initial Errors:
These 8 screenshots detail the various errors identified in the initial validation pass of `media.html`.

* **Error Screenshot 1: Duplicate Attribute**
    ![Media.html - Initial Errors Part 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/media_error1_kssrqg.png)

### Deprecated API Warning

![81 Best Practices for both index.html and media.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/best_practices_uknfel.png)  

While manual testing using the **in-browser Lighthouse tool**, both `index.html` and `media.html` received a **Best Practices score of 81** due to a **deprecated API**. The same warning can be found on the `gallery.html` but the are is also another issue (see below).

My project aims to follow **modern web best practices**, and during testing, a browser warning appeared regarding the **deprecated `unload` JavaScript event**, originating from `contentInject.js`.  

### Understanding the `unload` Event  

The `unload` event is an older, **unreliable feature** that can negatively impact browser performance by preventing the use of **back/forward cache (bfcache)**.  

Critically, `contentInject.js` is **not part of my project's codebase**; instead, it is typically an **injected script from browser extensions or development tools**.

### Why This is Not an Issue  

Since the warning originates **outside** my application’s codebase, it does **not** indicate an issue with **my website's functionality or performance**.  

I ensure that:
- **My code adheres to current standards**, prioritising **user experience** and **efficient browser navigation**.
- The presence of this warning does **not** imply a security risk or breaking change to my website.  

This documentation provides **clarity** on the nature of the warning and reinforces my commitment to **maintaining high coding standards**.

## Third-Party Cookies & Cloudinary 

![59 Best Practices in media.html](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/gallery_best_practices_gpscvm.png)

My website utilizes Cloudinary as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to host and serve image assets. When content is embedded from Cloudinary, third-party cookies are set in the user's browser, currently totaling 11 cookies from `res.cloudinary.com`. These cookies, such as `_cfuvid`, `_cld_session_key`, and `__cf_bm`, are primarily for Cloudinary's operational purposes (e.g., session management, security, performance optimization) and are not used by my application for user tracking or advertising.

Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) are increasingly restricting third-party cookies due to privacy concerns, aiming to reduce cross-site tracking. This means some of these cookies may be blocked depending on browser settings and future updates.

### My Approach & Considerations

While these cookies are not a critical issue for this project, I acknowledge their presence and consider the following factors:

- **Operational Necessity**: Cloudinary’s cookies ensure efficient and secure delivery of media. My application does not use them for user tracking or advertising purposes.
- **External Control**: Since these cookies are part of Cloudinary’s service infrastructure, I cannot directly modify or remove them.
- **Industry Evolution**: I am actively monitoring privacy-preserving technologies, including Google’s Privacy Sandbox, which aims to reduce reliance on third-party cookies.
- **Performance vs. Privacy Trade-off**: Self-hosting media would remove third-party cookies, but it comes at a cost to performance, scalability, and automatic optimizations that Cloudinary provides. In this project, the benefits of a CDN outweigh the implications of third-party cookies.

### Transparency & User Options

For transparency, users can manage their cookie preferences via browser settings. Most modern browsers allow control over third-party cookies through privacy configurations.

## Accessibility & SEO Improvement: Descriptive Link Text for Buttons

![Lighthouse media.html SEO text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/media_SEO_text_b0hgjl.png)

### Issue
Lighthouse flagged generic link text such as **"More"** on buttons, indicating a lack of context for screen readers and search engines. This hindered accessibility and SEO by making it unclear where the links lead.

![Lighthouse media.html SEO fixed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvsifzmes/image/upload/media_SEO_fixed_s9i70x.png)

### Fix
The text for all **"More"** buttons leading to external YouTube videos was updated to be highly descriptive. The generic "More" was replaced with clear, contextual phrases:

- **Watch "[Video Title]" on YouTube**

This provides immediate clarity on the link's destination and content, benefiting both **usability** and **search engine optimization**.

### Example Before & After

**Before:**
## HTML
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWPZC6uk3hM" class="btn btn-primary">More</a>

**After:**
## HTML
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWPZC6uk3hM" class="btn btn-primary">Watch "Bad Medicine" on YouTube</a>

## Benefits of the Fix
**Enhanced accessibility** – Screen readers now convey meaningful link destinations.  
**Improved SEO** – Search engines gain clearer understanding of the linked content.  
**Better user experience** – Users instantly know where the link leads without ambiguity.  

By implementing these changes, the website aligns better with best practices for **web accessibility** and **search engine optimization**, while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
